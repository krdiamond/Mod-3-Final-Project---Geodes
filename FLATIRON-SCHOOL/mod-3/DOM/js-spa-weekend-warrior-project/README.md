# JS SPA Weekend Warrior Project



![Spa](https://media.giphy.com/media/qYPuZHf0vFB6g/giphy.gif "Kitty 'SPA'")

You're going to be building a **SPA** or *S*ingle *P*age *A*pplication. Your frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also be tasked with constructing your own backend API built with Ruby on Rails. The frontend application will communicate with the backend by making requests and receiving responses. This is a really exciting moment, the whole course up until this point is coming together!

Building out each feature you want for your application will be challenging, but you all are awesome and can do it. Remember for this weekend project focus on an MVP (Minimum Viable Project). This will be great practice, getting you ready for the module 3 project.

### Requirements

1. Must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend with a Rails API backend. These should live in two separate repositories. All interactions between the client and the server should be handled asynchronously (using fetch).

2. Must render out **only two resources** total in the JSON. For example, if we were building Instagram, we might display a list of photos with associated comments. Both resources should be editable.

3. Must use your Rails API and a form generated by the client to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh. For example, if you create a new Photo post, the form data would be submitted via a fetch POST request, with the response being the new object in JSON, which can then be used for appending that new photo to the DOM using JavaScript.

4. **No user authentication with passwords. When the page refreshes the current user will effectively be signed out**. The way you learned this in the previous module relied on the fact that Rails was sending small pieces of data (cookies/sessions) back and forth along with every request and response. Now, we have two separate applications and need to use a slightly different pattern. We'll look at patterns for dealing with client-side auth later in the semester, so you'll have plenty of time to deal with this case.

   * If your application requires a user model you can have users "sign in" or "sign up" by providing a username and/or email, but hold off on passwords for now.

## Example Project Setup

[This repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/mod3-project-week-setup-example) goes through the first few steps of setting up an example project for both the frontend and backend applications. **Please spend some time looking through this before getting started**. If your question (ex: "How do i set up the `rack-cors` gem?") can be answered by reading this repository, you will be directed there.


USERS have_many :items
ITEMS have_many :users

*CORE FUNCTIONALITY*
  - In some kind of environment
  - Click on different areas until you can find a geode, they are hidden **JAVASCRIPT**
  - Open the geode by clicking on it to see whats inside, the geode ITEMS are then assigned to the USER and stored in their "pouch" or whatever **CREATE**
          - The geode ITEMS are random but there are some that are more rare than others
          - USER can take items out of their pouch and do funny/cute things with them (like as dumb as a dog sticking his tongue out or something)  **READ**    
  - USER can send their ITEMS to other users, items will then pop up in their "pouch" **EDIT**
  - USER can delete their ITEMS if they don't like an item or if they have  multiples of the same items  **DELETE**

*REACH GOALS*
- USER can package up their items into a geode before they are sent to another user, so that the user can open it  **EDIT**
- when a geode is found it is spit out to the center of the screen: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_animate.asp **JAVASCRIPT**
- Alert when a user receives  a new item from someone else



*STEPS FOR CORE*
  BACKEND
  - Set up backend to have Users and Items
  - Seed some items (unassigned to USERs) to start out with
  FRONT END
  - Set up environment to search for geodes
    - CSS: Create Background image
    - HTML/CSS: Create Hidden DIVs around the image with events assigned to them, triggered on click
    - JS: When DIV's are clicked an event is triggered and a Geode pops out
  - Set up method to find random ITEMS from the API
    - JS: Click on geode to crack open and find the random items inside
  - Set up method to assign random items to the USER on the API, items are assigned on breaking the geode click **CREATE**
  - Set up method to display the user's pouch of all the items that they have found **READ**
  - User can click on the items in their pouch and they can do cute things **READ**
  - Set up method to reassign the items to a different user thus sending them to another User's pouch **EDIT**
  - Set up method to delete items **DELETE**
